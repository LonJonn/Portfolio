This project was a simple WordPress site that I built with some friends for one of their family member's private tutoring service. Although this is a relatively small project, it was a real-world use-case for a CMS. I had some prior experience with CMS solutions, but only on local projects for my own testing.

This project was a way for my friends and I to learn about tools like WordPress for building simple websites. We shared equal responsibility when creating this website over the course of about a week.

**We were able to implement the following:**

- Shared layout with a CTA button
- Landing page with testimonials
- About Us page
- Tutor Recruitment page
- Contact Us page with email notifications for the business owner

There's honestly not much I can say about this project, aside from the fact that I'd much rather write my own mark-up and styles than fiddle with a WYSIWYG editor ðŸ˜‹. I still see the value in these tools, however, I'm personally more inclined to use headless CMS solutions such as Ghost, Strapi or Sitecore, that let me build my own presentational layer for them.
