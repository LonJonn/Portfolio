This project was a simple WordPress site that I built with some friends for a private tutoring service. Although this was a relatively small project, it was a real-world use-case for a CMS that provided a great leraning experience. I had some prior experience with CMS solutions, but only on local projects for my own testing.

This project was a great opportunity for us to learn about tools like WordPress for building simple static websites. We shared equal responsibility when creating this website over the course of about a week.

**We implemented the following:**

- Shared layout with a CTA button
- Landing page with testimonials
- About Us page
- Tutor Recruitment page
- Contact Us page with email notifications for the business owner

There's honestly not much I can say about this project, aside from the fact that I'd much rather write my own mark-up and styles than fiddle with a WYSIWYG editor ðŸ˜‹. I still see the value in these tools, however, I'm personally more inclined to use headless CMS solutions such as Ghost, Strapi or Sitecore, that let me build my own presentational layer for them.
