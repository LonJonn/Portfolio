> Level Up is a mock for an Occupation Health & Safety (OHS) upskilling application. It is intended as a platform for workers to learn and apply workplace-safety best practices. The depicted app would also make heavy use of Augmented Reality (AR) capabilities to present detailed demonstrations and walkthroughs within the workplace.

This project was created for the subject **Collaborative Business Processes (CBP)** at UTS. My group and I undertook the complete process of identifying a problem, gathering information, identifying requirements, and finally proposing a solution. We decided to tackle the issue of OHS within industrial workplaces as we found that majority of the injuries that occur within these industries are caused by lack of knowledge & real-world experience. **Level Up** aims to address this issue by providing an interactive platform for workers to gain real-world experience.

For this project, responsibility was mostly shared equally, however, I volunteered to design the application UI/UX myself as I believed it would be a great opportunity to further develop my design skills... _and no one else wanted to_. ðŸ™ƒ I was also taking another subject at the time, **Fundamentals of Interaction Design (FID)**, which allowed me to apply what I learnt from that subject!

This mock-up was designed entirely within Figma. I created a custom design system that ensured design consistency. Since the target platform was mobile, I also had to be mindful of issues such as text legibility, feedback and other concepts I had been taught in FID. UI is one thing, but the overall user experience (UX) also requires careful consideration. To create a seamless experience, I employed concepts I had learnt in FID such as [Nielson's Usability Heuristics][1] and other popular design techniques such as the [Gestalt principles][2]. I created an interactive prototype for people to click around within an simulated environment, complete with scroll functionality and navigation!

Overall, I am quite happy with the result ðŸ˜Š! Using Figma to design this application was an amazing experience and is something I now apply to _most_ of my projects. I really enjoy the creative aspect of designing UIs and I am certain that the experience I have gained throughout this project will help with future frontend projects!
