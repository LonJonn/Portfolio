Byte Sized is a simple cookie clicker game I made in high school with plain ol' HTML, CSS and JS! I was learning how to make a static website in class when I stumbled upon JavaScript. I decided I would make a cookie clicker game to learn JS since that's what all the cool kids were playing at the time ðŸ˜Ž. This was the first time I properly used JS to make something.

This was a really fun project that introduced me into the world of web-development. I used local storage to persist user scores and setup event handlers to handle user interaction. All data was stored in a simple object that was written to local storage every minute (which means it was very easy to cheat ðŸ˜…).

I had a lot of fun with the tech theme of the game. I wrote completely custom (and really bad) CSS and messed around with cute little animations!

I honestly had no idea what I was doing and the codebase is terrible, but I had such a great time messing around with JS and finding out what I can do with "just" a web browser!
