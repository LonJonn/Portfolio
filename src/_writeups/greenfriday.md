> 🏗 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 👷‍♂️

I still have to get around to writting about this project 🙈, but in the mean time you can poke around [this interactive archive](https://replayweb.page/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fportfolio-lonjonn.vercel.app%2Fwacz%2Fgreenfriday.wacz#view=pages&url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2F&ts=20221201042932). how cool!

**NOTE:** The link above will take you to an offline copy of the site during the live event period which has now ended. Network responses have been recorded and mocked, but not all have been accounted for so certain parts of the site may not work properly.
